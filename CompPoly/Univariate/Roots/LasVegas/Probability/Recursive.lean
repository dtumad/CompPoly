# Recursive Fallback Analysis for Las Vegas Splitting

The abstract binomial-tail bound for recursive fallback, together with the
multi-factor splitting process that witnesses it: the process tracks the full
stack of unresolved factors, gives every splittable factor its own batch of
independent uniform probes, and records which factors fell back to enumeration.

/--
Multi-factor Las Vegas splitting process for an abstract per-factor trial
family.

The stack of unresolved factors is processed sequentially. Every factor of
degree at least two receives its own batch of `attempts` independent trials;
the resulting trace records, in processing order, whether each such factor
fell back to enumeration (`true`) or split into children that are pushed back
onto the stack (`false`). This is the idealized-probe model of
`lasVegasSplitLoopWith`, which retries each unresolved factor up to the
configured cutoff before enumerating it.

Backend-level recursive fallback bound: over any finite field — odd, or binary
with matching trace metadata — the full Las Vegas recursion on a splitter-valid
input of degree `d` reaches exhaustive enumeration anywhere with probability at
most the binomial tail `2 ^ -attempts * ∑_{j ≤ d - 2} C(attempts, j)`.

Headline backend theorem: for any nonzero polynomial over a finite field — odd,
or binary with matching trace metadata — the Las Vegas backend run on its
finite-field root product reaches exhaustive enumeration anywhere in the
recursion with probability at most the binomial tail in the attempt cutoff.
