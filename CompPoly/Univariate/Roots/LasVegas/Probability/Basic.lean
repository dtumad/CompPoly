# Probability Basics for Las Vegas Root Splitting

Shared probability-side vocabulary for the Las Vegas splitter: event
probabilities, uniform enumeration models, split-trial results, and small PMF
lemmas about trial success and failure mass.

This module is intentionally separate from the executable splitter modules:
runtime root search remains pure and deterministic for a fixed `ProbeFamily`,
while the probability modules model idealized uniform probes. Runtime and
correctness modules must not import this file or any other probability module.

no duplicate indices and its size is the finite-field cardinality `q`.

Probability-facing odd-field model: the uniform enumeration size `q` is the
cardinality of the finite field, and that cardinality is odd.

This intentionally stays separate from the runtime splitter contract
`lasVegasSplitterInput`, which must not accumulate probability hypotheses.
