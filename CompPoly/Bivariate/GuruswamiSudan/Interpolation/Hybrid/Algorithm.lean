# Hybrid Guruswami-Sudan Interpolation

Output-sensitive interpolation backend combining the adaptive Lee-O'Sullivan
route with the order-driven approximant-basis route through a ski-rental
budget policy.

The Mulders-Storjohann reduction of the Lee-O'Sullivan basis terminates after
a number of steps that vanishes on codewords and scales with the distance of
the received word from the code, while the approximant-basis backend costs
the same on every input. The hybrid runs the reduction with a calibrated step
budget `B` as fuel; if the budget is exhausted before the basis is
conflict-free, it falls back to the approximant solver, so the total cost is
within a constant factor of the cheaper route on every input.

The budget is the entire fuel policy: the reduction loop stops by itself as
soon as the basis is conflict-free, so unused fuel is free and any cap below
`B` could only trigger premature fallback. (In particular the excess of the
initial shifted-degree sum over the weak-Popov floor is *not* a usable cap:
the step count includes leading-position moves that leave the shifted-degree
sum unchanged, so reductions routinely need more steps than that excess.)

The dispatch affects performance only: both branches are complete verified
interpolators, and `Interpolation/Hybrid/Correctness.lean` shows the hybrid
result always coincides with one of them.
