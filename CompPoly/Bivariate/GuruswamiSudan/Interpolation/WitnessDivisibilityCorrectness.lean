# Correctness of Divisibility-Based Witness Checking

`satisfiesMultiplicityConstraintsViaDivisibilityBool` agrees with the
pointwise Hasse checker `CBivariate.satisfiesMultiplicityConstraintsBool`
on point sets with distinct `x`-coordinates, and consequently
`interpolationWitnessIsValidViaDivisibilityBool` agrees with
`interpolationWitnessIsValidBool`.

The proof peels one base-`(Y - R)` digit per multiplicity level.

* Soundness: from `Q = C c + (Y - R) * Q'` with `c = W * G^(m+1)`, the digit
  term gains multiplicity `m + 1` from the `G`-power
  (`hasMultiplicityAtLeast_ofYConstant_pow_mul_eval_zero`), the quotient term
  gains one from `Y - R` (`hasMultiplicityAtLeast_linearYDivisor_mul`) on top
  of the inductive hypothesis, and multiplicity is closed under addition.

* Completeness: the quotient `Q'` keeps multiplicity `m` at every point
  (`witness_hasMultiplicity_quot`, by a strong induction on the
  `X`-coefficients of the Taylor-shifted division identity), so the digit
  `C c = Q - (Y - R) * Q'` has multiplicity `m + 1` with `Y`-degree zero, and
  `coeffY_dvd_vanishingPolynomial_pow_of_multiplicity` forces
  `G^(m+1) ∣ c`.
